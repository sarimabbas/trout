title: Webhooks
---

Webhooks are a powerful communication mechanism that enable real-time data exchange between different applications and systems. Unlike traditional APIs that require periodic polling for updates, webhooks provide an event-driven approach, allowing applications to send and receive data as soon as specific events occur.

## What are webhooks?

In simple terms, webhooks act as "notifications" that one application sends to another, informing it about a specific event or action that has taken place. These events can include actions like a new user sign-up, a successful payment transaction, or the completion of a task.

## The purpose of webhooks

The primary purpose of webhooks is to streamline data synchronization and keep multiple systems in sync without the need for constant manual checks. By sending a webhook, an application can immediately trigger an action in another system, ensuring both applications are up-to-date with the latest information.

## How webhooks work

1. Subscription: In the webhook setup process, the receiver provides a unique URL known as the webhook endpoint or webhook URL. The sender (e.g., Stripe, Clerk) will need this URL to deliver data when events occur.

2. Event Trigger: When a predefined event takes place in the sender application, such as a successful payment or a new customer record, the sender initiates an HTTP request to the webhook endpoint URL provided by the receiver.

3. Data Transmission: The data related to the event is sent as part of the HTTP request's payload. This data can be in various formats, such as JSON or XML, containing relevant information about the event.

4. Processing the Event: The receiver receives the incoming HTTP request at the webhook endpoint and processes the event data accordingly. This processing may include storing the data, triggering actions based on the event, or forwarding the data to other endpoints.

## Advantages of webhooks

- Real-time Updates: Webhooks provide instant updates, allowing applications to react immediately to events, improving overall responsiveness.
- Efficient and Scalable: With webhooks, data is delivered only when events occur, reducing unnecessary data requests and making the system more scalable.
- Reliable Data Delivery: Webhooks guarantee the delivery of data to the receiver, ensuring that crucial events are not missed.
- Automation and Integration: Webhooks automate the data transfer process, enabling seamless integration between different applications and services.

## Webhooks with Trout

Trout acts as both a receiver and sender in this process. It receives webhooks with sources, and sends them onward to sinks. With Trout's webhook relay service, developers can harness the power of webhooks to effortlessly route and manage data, simplifying their webhook integration workflows.
