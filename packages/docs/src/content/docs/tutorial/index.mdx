## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

1. Create a source to receive webhook events
2. Use the Trout CLI to inspect events in realtime
3. Create sinks to send events to other services
4. Connect sources and sinks together

## Creating a source

In the UI, click on "Sources" in the navigation. Then click on the "Create new source" button.

Click on the actions menu to reveal the "Copy webhook URL" option. Click on this to copy the URL to your clipboard.

You can plug this URL into any service that supports webhooks. For now, let's just try sending a test request to this URL using CURL. With a terminal open, run the following command:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"hello": "world"}' https://web.trout.run/<replace-with-your-url>
```

You will observe a success acknowledgement/response.

## Inspecting events locally with the CLI

You can use the Trout CLI to inspect events in realtime. Install the CLI using the following command (you need Node installed on your machine):

```bash
npm i @trout.run/cli -g
```

Enter `trout --help` to see the available commands. You can use `trout listen` to listen for events on a source.

```bash
trout listen --source xxxxx --forward xxxxx
```

You can find the source ID by clicking "Copy CLI command" in the UI.

You must also specify a `forward` option. This is the URL you would like to forward events to in local development. This is usually something like `localhost:PORT`. You can also just use a public [RequestBin](https://public.requestbin.com/r) to inspect events.

Let's try sending that CURL request again. You should see the event appear in the CLI, and in the RequestBin.

## Creating a sink

The CLI is useful for local development, but you will want to create a sink to forward events to a production service. In the UI, click on "Sinks" in the navigation. Then click on the "Create new sink" button.

Click on the actions menu to reveal the "Edit" option. Click on this to edit the sink and add a URL to forward events to. For now, let's just use a public [RequestBin](https://public.requestbin.com/r).

![Set url](/get-started/9-set-url.png)

## Connect your source and sink

Now that you have a source and a sink, you can connect them together. In the UI, click on "Connections" in the navigation. Then simply drag from one to the other.

Now you can try sending that CURL request again. You should see the event appear in the RequestBin.

## Conclusion

You made it! You now know how to create sources, sinks, and connections. You can use the Trout CLI to inspect events sent to sources in realtime. You can also use the Trout UI to connect sources and sinks together for production.
