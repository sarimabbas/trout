## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will walk through the following:

1. Using the UI to direct webhook events to a source
2. Inspecting the events in realtime using the Trout CLI
3. Directing webhook events from a source to a sink

## Creating a source

In the UI, click on the "Sources" tab. Then click on the "Create new source" button.

<video src="/create-source.mp4" controls />

If you click the actions menu, you'll see some options, including "Copy webhook URL". You can try to send a CURL request to this URL to see it in action.

<video src="/copy-url.mp4" controls />

<video src="/curl-url.mp4" controls />

## Installing the CLI

```
npm i @trout.run/cli -g
```

This will install the Trout CLI globally on your machine. It exposes one command, `trout`.

Use the following command to listen to events from a source:

```
trout listen --source xxxxx
```

## Creating a sink
