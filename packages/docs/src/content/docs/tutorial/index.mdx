## Introduction

Trout is a service to help you work with webhooks. To learn about what webhooks are and why they are useful, you can read [this article](https://zapier.com/blog/what-are-webhooks/).

In this tutorial, we will walk through the following:

1. Using the UI to direct webhook events to a source
2. Inspecting the events in realtime using the Trout CLI
3. Directing webhook events from a source to a sink

## Creating a source

In the UI, click on the "Sources" tab. Then click on the "Create new source" button.

<video src="/create-source.mp4" controls />

If you click the actions menu, you'll see some options, including "Copy webhook URL". You can try to send a CURL request to this URL to see it in action.

<video src="/copy-url.mp4" controls />

## Installing the CLI

```
npm i @trout.run/cli -g
```

This will install the Trout CLI globally on your machine. It exposes one command, `trout`.

Use the following command to listen to events from a source:

```
trout listen --source xxxxx
```

## Creating a sink

## Next steps

## Limitations

- Trout is currently in beta. It is not certified for use in production.
- Trout is currently aimed at indie developers. For complex webhook flows, you may need to use a different tool. Consider Convoy or Hookdeck.
